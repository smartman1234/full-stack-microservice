The goal is to design a working microservice architecture with the following components:

- Client/server-side service discovery (nodejs resilient)
- Consul/etcd setup
- Circuit breaker
- Docker-compose or nomad setup
- Dynamic ports and service registry
- 12-Factor app practices
- Heteregenous clients (nodejs, go, python)
- Transport protocol (kafka, nats, rabbitmq)
- Caching (Redis/memcache)
- API Gateway (kong)
- OpenID connect
